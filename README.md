Hello! I am glad that you are looking into my execution of the Tower of Hanoi game!
The Tower of Hanoi is a simple math based puzzle and is designed to test your logical and planning skills.
Numerous legends are present for the creation of the game, but the actual date could be sometime in the 19th century than lost in the fog of history.
Mathematically, the game can be solved in (2^n)-1 moves, where n is the number of disks present.
Do you think you have what it takes? Give the game a go and try for yourself!

Game setting
The game has 3 fixed poles and can have a varying number of disks - anywhere from 3 disks upwards. Just keep in mind that anything above 9 disks involve having a minimum move count of 1000+
The disks can be moved any number of times, but there is a very simple logic involved that just needs to be repeated to get all the disks in position.

Rules:
1. Only the top disk can be picked up from a rod.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.
3. Only one disk can be picked at a time.

Licensing:
Created on Unity platform, with no licenced models used.
The completed application has been created for Linux OS.

Advancements planned:
1. Difficulty levels with increased number of disks.
2. Game resume after quitting application.
3. Save high scores.
